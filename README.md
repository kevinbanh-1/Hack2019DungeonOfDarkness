# Hack2019DungeonOfDarkness
Game created from the ground up for Hacklahoma 2019 in collaboration with Bryan Tran (Github user: tran0095) and Jordyn Vu (Github user: jordyntvu).
Together, we built the 2D platformer game on Unity using C# and created our own pixel art to go along it within a period of 24 hours.
